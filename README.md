# EfficientNet with Robust Training: MICCAI Skin Cancer Analysis Challenge

## Summary

Recent deep learning studies have been explored in largely two directions: 1) Development of a strong model 
with efficiency. 2) Development of robust training methodologies to improve the target models. EfficientNet is 
a very  successful model architecture which is investigated in various applications [1]. Based  on EfficientNet, 
recently, various training methodologies have been investigated in [2] to improve the performance and the 
robustness by computer vision and machine learning communities. In this project, it is investigated
the effectiveness of EfficientNet and robust training methods in the medical image analysis area. In particular, it is studied  on  finding  the  optimal  data 
augmentation strategy using RandAugment for the target application (skin cancer diagnosis) [2]. Finally, the approach 
is evaluated on ISIC 2020 dataset and participated in MICCAI ISIC 2020 challenge [3].
